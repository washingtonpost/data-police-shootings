# Fatal Force Database

# :warning:*Announcement*:warning:

The Post has created an updated data structure, version 2, which will become the default data structure as of mid November. Please review [Data Versions](#data-versions) below for high-level context on the updates. Detailed Documentation as well as a sample of data in the new structure can be found in [Version 2](v2/).

In mid November:

- `data-police-shootings/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv` will be moved to `data-police-shootings/v1/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv`.  This file will become a _static_ archive of all data since Jan 1, 2015 in the V1 data structure. 
- `data-police-shootings/v2/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv` and `data-police-shootings/v2/fatal-police-shootings-agencies.csv` will begin regularly updating with all data since Jan 1, 2015 in the V2 data structure.


## Project

In 2015, The Post began tracking details about each police-involved killing in the United States — the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the person was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by manually culling local news reports, collecting information from law enforcement websites and social media, and monitoring independent databases such as [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/) and the now-defunct Killed by Police project. In many cases, The Post conducts additional reporting.

The 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. began a protest movement culminating in the Black Lives Matter movement and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. In this data set, The Post tracks only shootings with circumstances closely paralleling those like the killing of Michael Brown — incidents in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers nor non-shooting deaths in this data set.

The [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/use-of-force) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. Since 2015, The Post has documented more than twice as many fatal shootings by police as recorded by federal officials on average annually.

The Post seeks to make records as comprehensive as possible; the database is updated regularly as fatal shootings are reported and as facts emerge about individual cases. At times, there may be a lag between the date of the shooting and its inclusion in the database because of delays in reporting and data verification.
